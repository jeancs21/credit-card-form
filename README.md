![thumbnail-credi-card](https://github.com/jeancs21/credit-card-form/assets/40588173/6a170c6c-6ed3-4d44-9633-8d81d10a89d5)



This is a React project that consists of a dynamic component that simulates an animated credit card and a form for entering credit card details.

## Key Features

- **Animated Credit Card**: The component displays a visual representation of a credit card that updates in real-time with the data entered in the form. The card can rotate to show the backside, allowing for the entry of the CVC code.

- **Infinite Floating**: The credit card has an animation that makes it float infinitely, giving it a visually appealing and dynamic look.

- **Interactive Form**: The component includes a form where credit card details such as the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and CVC code can be entered. These details are automatically reflected on the credit card.
